# Campus Bookstore Application  
### CST-339 – Milestone 2: Main Application, Registration, and Login Modules  
*Collaborative Learning Community (CLC) Project*

---

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **CST-339 Enterprise Application Programming** course.  
Over the duration of this course, the team will design and build a complete **enterprise-class N-Layer web application** using **Spring Boot**.

This milestone focuses on building the **Main Application**, **Registration**, and **Login** modules, along with the **overall UI theme** and **responsive design**.

---

## Milestone 2 Requirements

### Main Application Module

- Develop the main application page (root URI).
- Implement **navigation and menu bar** for core features:
  - Login
  - Registration
- Apply consistent **styles, fonts, colors, and theme** across all pages.
- Use **Spring MVC** for all dynamic page generation.
- Include a clear **application title and logo**.
- Implement a **shared Thymeleaf layout** template for consistency.

---

### Registration Module

- Allow users to **register** for access to the application.
- Required registration fields:
  - First Name  
  - Last Name  
  - Email Address  
  - Phone Number  
  - Username  
  - Password  
- Validate all user input and provide **clear error messages**.
- Use **Spring MVC** for all dynamic rendering.
- Design a **User Object Model**.
- Create a **database model** (design only, no implementation required until Milestone 4).

---

### Login Module

- Create an **initial login page** that emulates authentication (no real database connection yet).
- Use **Spring MVC** for page rendering.
- Design a **Login/Principal Object Model**.
- Create a **database model** (design only, no implementation required until Milestone 4).
- Include **input validation and helpful error messages**.
- Once logged in, display the **main product page** and update the menu to reflect the logged-in state.
- **Spring Security** will be added in **Milestone 6** (no secure authentication required for now).

---

### Responsive Design

- Integrate **Bootstrap** for a responsive, mobile-first design.
- Ensure the app renders correctly on:
  - At least **one mobile device**
  - At least **one tablet**
  - At least **two desktop browsers**

---

## Development Standards

- Perform **peer code reviews** for all submitted code.
- **Document** all:
  - Classes
  - Methods
  - Modules
  - Inline comments
- Follow consistent naming and code style conventions.
- Notify the instructor if any **project management** or **collaboration** issues arise.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Updated Design Report
The Design Report must include:

- **Cover Page** – with team member names and a list of completed tasks  
- **Planning Documentation** – outline how the project is managed  
- **Design Documentation**, including:
  - General Technical Approach  
  - Key Technical Decisions  
  - Installation or Configuration Instructions  
  - Known Issues and Risks  
  - Sitemap Diagram  
  - User Interface Diagrams  
  - ER Diagram  
  - DDL Scripts  
  - Class Diagrams (for controllers and models)

---

### 2. Application Demonstration
- Record a **screencast** showing the application running locally.  
- Provide the **URL** to the screencast in the report.

---

### 3. Source Code
- Push **all source code** to a shared **GitHub repository**.
- Submit a **ZIP file** of the full project along with the Design Report.

---

## Submission Details

- Submit all deliverables as directed by your instructor.  
- **APA style** is not required.  
- Maintain **clear, academic-quality writing** in documentation.  
- This assignment does **not require submission to LopesWrite**.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot 3.5.6**
- **Java 23**
- **Thymeleaf**
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **Spring MVC**
- **Spring Validation**
- **Maven**
- **Git / GitHub**

---

## Team Collaboration

This is a **Collaborative Learning Community (CLC)** project.  
Each team member contributes to:
- Planning and task management  
- Code development and review  
- Documentation and presentation  

---

## Next Steps

- Implement **database integration** in **Milestone 4**.  
- Add **security features** (Spring Security) in **Milestone 6**.  
- Continue refining UI and UX for responsiveness and accessibility.
